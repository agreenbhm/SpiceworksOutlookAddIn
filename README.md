# SpiceworksOutlookAddIn
An Outlook 2013/2016 add-in for performing various actions with Spiceworks tickets.

This add-in allows you to perform various ticket commands quickly from within Outlook.  The current features are:

* Create a new ticket by forwarding an email (ticket created as original sender)
* Close a ticket
* Close a ticket and add a message
* Assign a ticket to another user

My inspiration for creating this was the constant barrage of emails I receive from users who are not following proper procedure for IT support (aka emailing me directly rather than the helpdesk email account).  With this add-in, when you receive an email from a user that should have gone to Spiceworks, just click the "Create Ticket" button and the message will be forwarded to the helpdesk email account with a "#created by" tag specifying the original sender of the message.

Make sure you go into the Settings screen and specify at least the email address for Spiceworks.  You can also add email addresses for other helpdesk employees, allowing you to assign tickets to those people on-demand.  There are also options to automatically close the message once an action is performed and to disable various confirmation prompts.

Oh yea, this add-in can perform actions on multiple tickets at a time, too!
